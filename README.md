# Data-Science-Project_Covid-Prediction
This project aims to apply machine learning models to predict the monthly death number in US
counties from open source datasets on the Internet. Nearly one hundred features on the county level are considered for
the accurate prediction of the death number in every county in March 2022. After thoughtful
feature engineering, regularization, and cross-validation, an optimal linear regression model is
proposed for the task. Root mean squared error (RMSE) and R-squared value are used to evaluate
the models. The prediction can help local officials to be prepared for the severity of the upcoming
covid trend and help them make the best opening decisions for their county.
